# ADS-509--Political-Naive-Bayes-Project

In this assignment we have done the following below:

Part 1:
We build a Na√Øve Bayes classifier on the convention speeches, using the words of the speech text to predict the party (either Republican or Democratic). 

Part 2:
We have a pretty gigantic database of tweets (and other data) from everyone running for congress in 2018. As an exercise, we used this convention model to classify those tweets.
